# OSCAR code for sparse GL\_k invariants over GF(2)

This repository contains an `OSCAR` implementation of a sparse, highest-weight-only algorithm
for computing GL\_k–invariants in the quotient module \( (QP_k)_n \) over \(\mathbb{F}_2\), based on
the hit problem and the GL\_k–action generated by adjacent transpositions and a transvection.

The main focus here is the case \(k = 6\) and input degrees \(n = 17, 40\), together with
a similar verification in the four-variable case \(k = 4\).

## Contents

- `Code_OSCAR_Compute_QPk_and_invariants` (Julia source file)  
  Sparse implementation of the GL\_k–invariant algorithm over \(\mathbb{F}_2\), with:
  - on-the-fly admissible basis construction;
  - weight-space decomposition;
  - Σ\_k- and GL\_k-invariants computed by bit-packed Gaussian elimination;
  - optional parallel execution (multi-process + multi-threading).

(Depending on your local setup, the file may appear with an extension such as `.jl` or `.julia`.)


In the paper, this code is referred to as the supplementary file `Code_OSCAR_Compute_QPk_and_invariants`.

## Requirements

- Julia (version 1.x)
- The `OSCAR` computer algebra system and its dependencies

In Julia, you can install OSCAR via the package manager, for example:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Oscar")
